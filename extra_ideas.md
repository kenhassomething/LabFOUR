Ideas on how to expand on the project at a later point:

1. --Prevent users from saying any character outside of Y (yes) or N (no) (not case-sensitive) when asked to continue.-- (Completed)
2. Throw an exception (or the option to throw) if isPrime is given 1, as it is technically is neither a prime or composite number.
3. Prevent users from inputing complete strings when asked to continue.
4. Stop getInput() from creating an infinite loop when a character is inputed.
5. Prevent users from inputing any characters or strings into getInput().
6. Prevent negative integers from being passed into isPrime()
7. Create a separate file and header file for isPrime()
8. Prevent the user from inputing an integer greater than the int max limit.
9. Overload the isPrime function to allow it to use long ints, letting it check higher numbers
